## Self-Introduction:
  I am Ilyass Hmamou, currently a computer science undergraduate in my final term, about to graduate. For the past six years, I've had a professional career in the software industry, starting as a software engineer and later transitioning into the role of a software solution architect. 
I have been in the computer science program for approximately eight years. I started with an associate's degree from a two-year college, leading to my first job as a software engineer. After a few years, I realized my ambition to attain a bachelor's degree and thus transferred my credits to SNHU. For the past four years, I've been steadily taking one or two classes each term to finally graduate at the end of this year, 2023.
While a significant portion of my knowledge and skills was acquired through hands-on professional experience, enrolling in the academic program has notably enhanced my problem-solving abilities. It has also introduced me to a variety of interesting tools outside my usual work domain and deepened my understanding of fundamental tasks, such as class design and database architecture, which I previously executed instinctively.
Looking forward, my career goals primarily revolve around securing positions in engineering management. Although my current role as a software solution architect is an important step in that direction, I believe that furthering my education in computer science with an advanced degree will be invaluable. 

## Project Introduction: Artifacts Selection

 For the final project, the requirement involves evaluating one to three artifacts that I have previously developed in either coursework or a professional setting. Subsequently, I am tasked with implementing three improvements to the chosen artifact(s). The first enhancement should pertain to Software Design and Engineering, the second one focuses on Algorithms and Data Structures, and the final improvement is associated with Databases.
  I decided to choose the "Salvare Search For Rescue App." as my artifact. It was developed during the period between September 2023 and October 2023 as a component of the final project for CS-340: Client/Server development course. 
The application enables users to engage with data from an existing animal shelter database through two distinct methods: an interactive data table equipped with built-in filters, and an interactive map within a user-friendly interface. Constructed with the utilization of the Python language, pyMongo driver, Dash framework, and MongoDB, the app provides a comprehensive user experience.
